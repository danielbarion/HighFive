# First part - "Engagement" 
# 1) Target the player that you want to make a couple with.
# 2) Use the voice command ".engage nameofyourpartner" then press enter.
# 3) If the target player has you on listed as a friend (ie. you are in each other's friends list) a popup will appear with an engagement request along with a system message that you want to be engaged with him/her.
# 4) If the target player accepts the engagement invitation, you will be engaged.
# 
# Second part - "Marriage" 
# 1) Once two players are engaged, they can speak to Andromeda, the Wedding Priest in the Hot Springs Guild House (Goddard Area).
#    (You may need Formal Wear and Adena to pay wedding fees!)
# 2) Each player needs to speak to the NPC and make the request to be married.
# 3) Once done, fireworks will display and the two players will be married.
# 
# Afterwards you can use the voice command ".gotolove nameofyourpartner" to teleport to your partner if you're married (there may also be a fee which can be specified below)

# If you want to cancel your Engagement/Marriage, use the voice command ".divorce nameofyourpartner".
