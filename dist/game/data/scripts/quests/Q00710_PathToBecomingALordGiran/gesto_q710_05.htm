What brought you here?<br>
That seal! Where did you find it?<br>
Under the pirate ship tunnel bridge at the entrance of the Devil's Isle, eh? Could it be that the infamous Zaken is again on the loose? No...I don't think Zaken could leave. It must be his followers... .<br>
I have an idea. Go to your master and ask him to have a look at the freight. If the pirate zombies attacked, there must be evidence on it. You should examine it also.<br>
If you find evidence of their involvement, kill all the pirates of Devil's Isle and recover our freight. They took 550 containers, but I'm sure some of them have been destroyed.<br>
I would be satisfied if you could recover even 300 of them. Please hurry!
