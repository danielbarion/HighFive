<html><body>Ketra's Messenger Wahkan:<br>
There are several phases of friendship:<br>
Fight bravely for the Ketra, and the Ketra will take care of you.<br>
You must kill not only the henchmen but also the commander to win the war against the Varka Silenos Village. Kill every goatee you can find! Keep killing them! The war isn't over until all the filthy Varka are wiped off the earth!<br>
I will give more confidence and trust to those who bring the insignia of the Wahkan Varka Rank - 200 soldiers with the insignia of the Varka Rank - 100 Non-Commissioned Officers. The insignia of the Varka Rank - Non-Commissioned Officer can be obtained when you kill <font color="LEVEL">the Priest of Varka Silenos, a Warrior, a Spiritual Medium, a Non-Commissioned Officer, a Chief Officiating Priest, a Commander of an Army Corps and an Elite Military Escort</font>. Go forward, friends of Ketra!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Remember not to lay a finger on our Ketra Orc tribe! This would destroy our alliance!</font>
