What can I say about Dr. Helvetica? The only things I know about him are from his correspondance and idle gossip.<br>
I've heard that he is somewhat of a genius, finding fame and notoriety through his tenure at the Pavel Laboratory. Like Doctor Chaos, he had outgrown the confines of such a stifflingly correct administration. He claims to want the land to the north to build a research facility. It would surely help Innadril's development if I were to support his cause.<br>
