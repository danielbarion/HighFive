I'm serious as the grave.<br>
What good is that land doing completely undeveloped? Does that reed field make money? Is it benefiting anybody at all?<br>
Dr. Helvetica just wants to ulitize the land... give it a purpose. Developing on that land won't just make him money, it will make money for us all. Can't you see that?<br>
The day that Athenia's plan puts adena in my pocket will be the day that I re-evaluate my decision. But until that time, my patronage goes to Helvetica. Ponder that on your way out.
