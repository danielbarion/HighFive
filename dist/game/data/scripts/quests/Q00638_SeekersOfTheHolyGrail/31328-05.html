<html><body>High Priest Innocentin:<br>
Please go to the <font color="LEVEL">Pagan Temple</font> and defeat the evil ones that inhabit it! After you've destroyed them, bring me their <font color="LEVEL">Pagan Totems</font>. You'll be well-rewarded if you bring more than <font color="LEVEL">2000</font> of them! Of course, our definitions of large rewards might differ...<br>
As you must have guessed, the Pagan Temple is heavily defended and will not be easily overtaken. <font color="LEVEL">Priest Eliyah could give you guidance on how to penetrate their defenses.<br>
