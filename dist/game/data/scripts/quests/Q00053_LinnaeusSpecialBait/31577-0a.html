<html><body>Fishermen's Guild Member Linnaeus:<br>
A while back, I accidently reeled in several strange boxes while fishing. When I opened them, I discovered that they contained many valuable items, much more precious than fish!<br>
I have a knack for finding these boxes, but I can't show you how to do it yet.<br>
