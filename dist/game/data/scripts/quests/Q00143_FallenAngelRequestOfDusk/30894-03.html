I do not know the angel's location, but we have been requested to search for something called the <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Prophecy: Path of the God</font>.<br>
Your predecessor has already secured it...<br>They think it contains clues to the whereabouts of the angel.<br>
Apparently, once the angel is located, its message can be recorded using a unique Echo Crystal...<br>
Now, go to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias in the town of Gludio</font> and ask him about the matter...<br>
Here, take the Sealed Prophecy: Path of the God with you...
