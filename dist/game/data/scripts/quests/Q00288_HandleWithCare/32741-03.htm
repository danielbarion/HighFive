Oh, one last thing before you go. There are these plants called <font color="LEVEL">Abyss Weed</font> that grow around <font color="LEVEL">Tanta Seer Ugoros</font>. When he eats these plants it restores him and turns his scales into armor.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">His scales are of the best quality when he has NOT eaten the abyss weed.</font><br>
If you can get me this type of scale your reward might be more than you imagine. Do we have a deal?<br>
