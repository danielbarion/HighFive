Hmm...<br>
since it was abandoned for a long time, the prisoners of the camp -- all monsters -- now rule it.<br>
There are web-like secret paths known only to them.<br>
And those paths are connected to the areas controlled by the monsters on the surface.<br>
Ironic, isn't it, that the monsters that were captured so long ago now have built their own hierarchy of evil here...<br>
