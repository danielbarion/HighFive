The Mucrokians stimulate the contamination of this region. And for that reason, they must be exterminated.<br>
Hunt down <font color="LEVEL">Mucrokian Fanatics, Mucrokian Ascetics, Mucrokian Saviors, Mucrokian Preachers and Awakened Mucrokians</font>. Tear off the hide of each one you kill. Amidst their ranks you will also find <font color="LEVEL">Contaminated Mucrokians</font>. For each of these that you kill, you will be able to salvage two hides.<br>
Collect as many as you can, and return to me. If you've brought enough, I will exchange them for Dynasty accessory recipes.
