<html><body>Captain Mouen:<br>
The favor I ask is on behalf of <font color="LEVEL">Magister Rovia</font> of the Temple of Einhasad. The Sages of Magic, a group of magisters of which Magister Rovia is a member, are researching the Kaneus: recently discovered monsters of Kamaloka.<br>
They know that Kamaloka exists between this world and the infernal regions; "normal" monsters in that region mutate into the Kaneus.<br>
They do not know the cause of this mutation, however.<br>
To assist their research into this matter, they asked me to obtain some <font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of the Kaneus</font>. Will you help me?<br>
(Only characters who may enter Kamaloka, Hall of the Abyss level 53 and 56, may undertake this quest.)<br>
