<html><body>Officer Tepios:<br>
Up until very recently, we had managed to stabilize and control each area by occupying the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity</font>. But now the power of Ekimus is again growing strong, and the undead have again awakened and re-occupied both areas. We think Ekimus will be again reach full strength very soon.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Predators of Soul</font> are directly supplying him with energy. Unless they are stopped, the entire Seed will fall into the possession of the undead.<br>
We need volunteers to help <font color="LEVEL">defend the Heart of Infinity</font>. Will you join them?<br>
