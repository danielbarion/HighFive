I will tell you about the area you will enter and what you must do there.<br>
The Heart of Infinity consists of 6 rooms connected to a circular passage. In the center of the passage you will find what we call the <font color="LEVEL">Center Tumor</font>. <font color="LEVEL">Soul Predators</font> roam the passage, sucking soul energy which they use to re-awaken Ekimus.<br>
Your mission is to prevent the Center Tumor from becoming a Soul Coffin capable of directly supplying energy to Ekimus. If <font color="LEVEL">20</font> Soul Coffins are created, you will have failed.<br>
The key to this battle is to defeat the Soul Predators, who will appear in greater numbers.<br>
Also, once a Soul Coffin is created, Ekimus' <font color="LEVEL">Evil Dog of the Netherworld</font> will appear in anticipation of his master's resurrection. That creature <font color="LEVEL">cannot be slain</font>. Do you understand?<br>
