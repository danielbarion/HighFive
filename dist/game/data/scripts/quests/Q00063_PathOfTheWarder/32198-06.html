<html><body>Master Gobie:<br>
Speak up! Captain Bathis must have treated you with contempt, eh?<br>
A good lesson for you that not all the races in this Outer World see us the same way.<br>
Some respect us as equals, others see us simply as sword fodder in battle.<br>
Even individuals within a race treat us differently...<br>
As newcomers to the mainland, we dare not risk offending any of these races now.<br>
In fact, our orders are to provide assistance to each of them impartially.<br>
So, we must learn to govern our tempers...<br><br>
