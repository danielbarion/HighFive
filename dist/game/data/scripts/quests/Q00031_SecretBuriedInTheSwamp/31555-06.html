According to Krorin's journal, there should be four monuments left behind by the people of the ancient empire. They must be scattered around the swamp... <br>
I've heard that the monuments were used as datum points for making astronomical observations. It seems that Krorin had located the first monument, so you'll want to follow the route marked in his journal. Beyond that, Krorin writes that there are strange characters drawn on the monuments which you must decypher in order to learn the location of the next monument. Those ancient people and their puzzles! Good luck!
