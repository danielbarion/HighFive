When the dragons inside <font color="LEVEL">Antharas's Lair</font> are injured, they bleed two types of liquid.<br>
I remember the stories that the adventurers told me about those dragons.<br>
That liquid is actually the dragons' blood.<br>
If you refine their blood, it can be used by humans.<br>
If you collect those liquids and bring them to me, I will refine them for you.<br>
But the refined dragon blood can only be used where the dragon's magic power can be felt. But if you would still like them, bring them to me.<br>
