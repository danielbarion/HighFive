The Temple and the Lords of Dawn believe that Einhasad created Humans, and they see themselves as righteous because they are her followers.<br>
They believe that the other gods and their followers are inferior and should unite under their command to battle the forces of Shilen...<br>
They value order and justice above all, and feel that diversity leads to dissention, which will undermine the war effort.<br>
In their eyes, only a strictly ordered society can ensure peace and the protection of the weak.<br>

Their ultimate goal is to re-establish a strong empire like the old days under Emperor Shunaiman...<br>
