Hi, I'm an investigator from the city assigned to the Plains of the Lizardmen. Truth is, I couldn't be happier. There are SO many plants here that I've never seen. Rare ones, big ones, pointy ones, pretty ones, never seen anywhere else. But there's a problem... I'm not strong enough to handle being alone out on the Plains.<br>
