There are three plants that we're especially curious about. Well, not all are plants - two are forms of fungus. The Fantasy Mushroom, Stick Mushroom, and Energy Plant are extremely plentiful on the Plains of the Lizardmen, but the strange thing is, they aren't found anywhere else in the world. All I can think about is studying these species! Or more specifically, the effects these plants have. That's... that's the part I really like.<br>
Maybe you know?<br>
