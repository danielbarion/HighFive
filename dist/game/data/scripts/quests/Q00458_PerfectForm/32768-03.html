Oh nothing much. We take a look at the area to see what can be done and then ask would-be-adventure-seekers such as you to do it.<br>
For instance, the Beast Farm. There are a lot of animals that can be temperamental if raised incorrectly. So, we use that as inspiration when creating a challenge. But it can't be as easy as "kill X of Y". That is just so boring. No, you have to add in a little flare to it.<br>
