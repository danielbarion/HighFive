You're back! Let's see here... Ah, you've brought quite a few <font color="LEVEL">Vulture's Golden Feathers</font>. You must have succeeded in defeating <font color="LEVEL">Master Rider Valdstone</font>, or have defeated a great many <font color="LEVEL">Vulture Riders or Elite Riders</font>. Ha ha! This will put a dent in their plans. I'm delighted with your progress!<br>
Here is the reward I promised you. I know it's not much compared to what you've gone through, but I hope it helps.<br>
Say...you've got a real knack for this. Care to go back out and hunt some more?<br>
