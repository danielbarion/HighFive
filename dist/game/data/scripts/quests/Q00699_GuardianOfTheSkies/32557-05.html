Bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Vulture's Golden Feather</font> as evidence that you've defeated <font color="LEVEL">Master Rider Valdstone</font> and scattered his followers, the <font color="LEVEL">Vulture Riders and Elite Riders</font>. You must defeat these pirates and protect the safety of our air space! You're not thinking of quitting, are you?<br>
