You've already dealt with the Vulture Riders or Elite Riders before, so you know how dangerous they are. Fortunately, they can't directly attack Keucereus Alliance Base because of the <font color="LEVEL">Barrier Orb</font> handed down from the Giants. But they roam the area as pirates, attacking merchants or isolated bands of soldiers.<br>
The leader of the Vulture Riders is a <font color="LEVEL">Master Rider called Valdstone</font>. He was once the lord of Gracia, but he refused the power of the seed, chose to accept some infernal power, and was subsequently corrupted. He and his minions are a legitimate threat we must take seriously.<br>
That's why I'm asking you this. Will you defeat Master Rider Valdstone? If you succeed, the power of the Vulture Riders and Elite Riders will be greatly reduced. How about it? Will you attempt it?<br>
