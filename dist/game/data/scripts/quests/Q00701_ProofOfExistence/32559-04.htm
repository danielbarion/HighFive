Excellent!<br>
Then go defeat <font color="LEVEL">Banshee Queen Enira</font> that lurks near the Seed of Infinity. You should also destroy the <font color="LEVEL">Floating Zombies and Floating Skulls</font> that always accompany this monster. As evidence of your victory, bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Banshee Queen's Eye</font> as well as <font color="LEVEL">Skeletal Remains</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">Floating Zombies and Floating Skulls</font>. I promise you that you will be rewarded for your help. But don't forget that these monsters only appear at night!
