Oh! You've returned? Ah, you have the Banshee Queen's Eye! Thanks to this proof, I'm sure the soldiers will feel better about the whole situation. Thank you very much! Don't worry about the reward. I will give more for destroying the Floating Skulls and Floating Zombies. Can you also make sure that the <font color="LEVEL">Banshee Queen</font> hasn't reappeared? The power of the Seed of Infinity can resurrect even these creatures, making it necessary to destroy them several times. Any help you can give me will be much appreciated. Remember, you have to hunt them at night. You're not going to stop now, are you?<br>
