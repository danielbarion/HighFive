<html><body>War Mage Artius:<br>
We've recently seen a drop in the morale of the soldiers of Gracia. There is a rumor that some soldiers who ventured near the Seed of Immotality saw <font color="LEVEL">something strange</font>. Perhaps it was a ghost or an evil spirit; some say they saw a beautiful woman. But when they approached it, it disappeared -- only to appear suddenly elsewhere and attack them! Now our soldiers are frightened to venture outside the Barrier Orb. Pitiful, isn't it?<br>
If you were a more experienced adventurer, perhaps you could go out and determine the truth of these rumors.<br>
(Only characters who are level 78 and above and have completed the "Good Day for Flying" quest may undertake this quest.)
