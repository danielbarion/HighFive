<html><body>Priest Kanis:<br>
They say that a monster named <font color="LEVEL">Balor</font> rules over the <font color="LEVEL">Water Dragon's Cave</font>.<br>
I believe that Balor guards the place where the Shamaness is being held captive.<br>
If that is the case, you will only be able reach the Shamaness by defeating Balor.<br>
That creature is said to be far stronger and more frightening than ordinary monsters, so please be careful...<br>
