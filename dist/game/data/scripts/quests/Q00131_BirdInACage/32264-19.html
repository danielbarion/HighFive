Ah, the notorious Demon Beleth... So the Shamaness reports in her letter.<br>
She says that she was due to be transported shortly to Beleth's stronghold on Hellbound Island.<br>
You succeeded in rescuing her in the nick of time!<br>
This could have been an even worse disaster...<br>
Apparently, though, several others from the Oracle, including several high-level priests with the weakened power of the Water Dragon, were taken to there.<br>
Once Innadril's Elven Army has been summoned, it will likely have to mount a major rescue operation.<br>
The Shamaness was able to describe in general terms the presumed location of Beleth's stronghold, at least.<br>
I now have many things to attend to.<br>
Oh, this is one of the Oracle's treasures -- the Shamaness has instructed me to give it to you with her gratitude.<br>
Please speak to me if you are interested in Beleth's stronghold on Hellbound Island...<br>
Thank you again for all your help.<br>
I will pray that divine blessings rain down upon your path.
