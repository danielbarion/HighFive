<html><body>Water Dragon's Shamaness Parme:<br>
(As she listens, the Shamaness continues to tenderly hold her head in her hands.)<br>
Uhh... Uhh...<br>
...<br>
Ahh! I remember everything now.<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
There is so much to tell, but...<br>
It would be best to leave this place first.<br>
I will go to a secret location to take care of a number of tasks for the Water Dragon that cannot be delayed.<br>
I am sorry to not be able to tell you more, even after you saved me.<br>
But it is that important...<br>
I will teleport you outside.<br>
(The Shamaness begins to write a letter.)<br>
Please deliver this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Kanis</font>.<br>
We must go now!<br>
(The Shamaness concentrates for a moment and then begins chanting a spell.)<br>
