<html><body>Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>
Very well. Here is a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape to the Town of Giran</font> as well a <font color="LEVEL">Traveler's Mark</font>.<br>
The Scroll can only be used once, remember! When you are ready to return to the Elven Village, visit Trader Galladucci and show him the Traveler's Mark.<br>
A word of warning: Giran is a crowded and chaotic place, filled with all manner of scum and villainy.<br>
Watch your back and your gold!
