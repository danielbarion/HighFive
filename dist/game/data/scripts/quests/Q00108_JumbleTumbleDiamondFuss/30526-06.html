Woot?! Is that Murdoc's coal...? How did you...?<br>
Oh yeah! The treasure chests must have been mixed up! Haha...! How could it have...?! Hey, don't look at me.. Somehow the chest with diamonds got mixed up with the treasure chest of <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Murdoc</font>. Hahaha... ah nuts.<br>
Look, I'm sorry, I'll write a letter explaining this whole mess. Give it to Warehouse Keeper Murdoc. He can correct this for us.
