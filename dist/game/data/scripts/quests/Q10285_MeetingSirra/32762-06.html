It's our castle and you'll need the help of those within to defeat her. We were all caught up in Freya's destructive web: not just the knights, soldiers, and nobles but also the butlers, servants, and cooks. Even myself, the Grand Head Chamberlain. While we cannot defy Freya's will, we know she poses a dire threat to the world and we may still be able to help. I assure you that you will need it.<br>
