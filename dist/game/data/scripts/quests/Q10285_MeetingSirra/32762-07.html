We can isolate Freya's essence and seal it in what is called a frozen core, a device not unlike the ice crystal that began this whole thing. It so happens I am capable of making this device! I assure you, it is not because I am fabulous, though I am. It is part of the curse Freya placed on me. She believes her power over her consorts so great that I would never move against her, and in a way it is true. But I can give you this, and my curse will become your gift. Join us, we can stop Freya together!<br>
