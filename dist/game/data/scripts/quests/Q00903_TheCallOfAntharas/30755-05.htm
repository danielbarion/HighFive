<html><body>Watcher of Antharas Theodric:<br>
The leather from these beasts contains a mysterious power of the land dragon Antharas. Why is this interesting? Imagine the possibilities... Antharas leather jackets... or boots... well maybe nothing quite so silly but you get the idea.<br>
I would love to have some of their hides in order to test out my theory.<br>
If you happen to fight Antharas and kill these beasts would you bring me their leather? I would be willing to compensate you for your efforts.<br>
