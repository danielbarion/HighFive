<html><body>Vice Hierarch Zenya:<br>
Welcome, young one. Do you wish to become a strong warrior or a great adventurer? It will be difficult to achieve either without adequate experience. You must see the world, meet various people and overcome many diverse trials.<br>
In that vein... Why don't you leave our little island and take a journey to a city on the continent, where you can encounter many races, creeds and adventures. Once you have experienced life there for a while, return here and see me.<br>
(This quest is available only to Kamael characters who are level 3 or higher.)
