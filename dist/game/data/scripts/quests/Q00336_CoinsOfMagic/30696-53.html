You have probably played a game like this before. This is an old tradition of the coin collector's club. The object of the game is to guess the sequence of colors of three coins that I have hidden. If you guess any part of the sequence correctly, I will tell you how many you got right. This is repeated until you figure out the answer. Ordinary mages do well at this game.<br>
