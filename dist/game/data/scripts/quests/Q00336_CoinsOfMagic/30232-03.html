I can see that you are a person of high integrity! My first impression of you was correct! Now I shall give you the details.<br>
You know Bernard, the president of the Hunters Guild? He has been showing off a coin that he claims is lucky. Actually the coin is known as <font color="LEVEL">Kaldis's Gold Dragon</font> among collectors. It is an extremely rare coin!<br>
It is a pity that such a rare object is owned by an idiot who has no idea of its true value! I offered to pay that moron Bernard anything he asked but he stubbornly refused. I would appreciate it if you could talk him out of his coin and bring it back to me.<br>
