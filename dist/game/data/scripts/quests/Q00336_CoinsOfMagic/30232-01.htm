<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Sorint:<br>
I have been under the weather lately. I have found something that I desire more than anything I have ever desired before. Only one thing stands between me and my object of desire. A damn fool who insists that it is a family heirloom, with no regard for its true value. I have been frustrated by an idiot!  <br>
If someone more tactful than myself could talk to him, perhaps that moron will see the error of his ways...<br>
(Only a character of level 40 or above can undertake this quest.)
