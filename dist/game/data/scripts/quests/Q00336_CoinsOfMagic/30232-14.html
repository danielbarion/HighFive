Aye, how time does fly! It seems like only yesterday that you joined our Coin Collectors Club, and here you are already bucking to be A-Grade 1 Member! 'Tis easier to beard a dragon in his lair than it is to earn A-Grade 1 Member Certificate, though. Still, I like the looks o' you — just don't let me down.<br>Your task, if you're up to it, requires you to collect some very special coins. Hold nothing back to bring the following coins to me: <br>
<font color="LEVEL">1 Silver Dryad</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">1 Blood Basilisk</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">1 Blood Succubus</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">1 Silver Undine</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">1 Gold Giant</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">1 Gold Wyrm</font><br>
May your ancestors guard your quest!
