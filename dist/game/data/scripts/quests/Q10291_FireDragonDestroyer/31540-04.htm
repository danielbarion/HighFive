<html><body>Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
I can see that you are determined despite my warnings. I will not try to stop you any further from your haste to find a quick death.<br>
However, should you be one of the lucky few to actually survive the encounter with Valakas you will need proof that you have defeated the Fire Dragon.<br>
