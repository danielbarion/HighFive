<html><body>Collector Gutenhagen:<br>
The job is to take care of these Golems.<br>
Yumi's been doing it alone, but she needs help, someone she can rely on.<br>
Any Golems belonging to the Horrifying Golem Army are fine.<br>
You will be dealing with Guard Golems inside the building or Jackhammer Golems in the Strip Mines. When you collect <font color="LEVEL">500 fragments</font> from them I'll trade you for some items out of the Collector Guild.<br>
Good luck golem smasher!
