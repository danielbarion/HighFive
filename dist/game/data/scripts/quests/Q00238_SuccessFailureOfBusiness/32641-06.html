If i think about it, shouldn't this Magic Square be a lifeless organism even if it may be the symbol of that Purified Ceremony Hall? I think one can destroy something like this to be a spy.<br>
But if you're really a spy from the Purified Ceremony Hall, you won't be able to destroy the <font color="LEVEL">Guardian Spirit of the Magic Square</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Evil Spirit close in the Magic Square</font>, which are almost like their companions. Thus, I won't be able to doubt you anymore if you can destroy those and bring <font color="LEVEL">20 broken fragments of the Guardian Spirit</font>.<br>
Thus, please hurry and leave for the Purified Ceremony Hall!
