You ask for the gift I received from the Water Dragon itself when I was young. It is very precious to me.<br>
Tell me, did you think I would simply hand it over to you?<br>
Hmmph!<br>
But since <font color="LEVEL">Galate</font> asked you to retrieve this not simply to test you, but because she actually needs it... Very well, take this to her. I hope this is the last time our paths cross...
