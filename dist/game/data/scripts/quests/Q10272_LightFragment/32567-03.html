<html><body>Shilen Priest Lelrikia:<br>
The Dark Black Dragon was a follower of Shilen and widely regarded as one of the most powerful Dragons in existence. But it is imprisoned just like the goddess herself... That's the official history.

I do not know much about Tiat, but it is obvious that her power was inherited form the Dark Black Dragon.<br>
