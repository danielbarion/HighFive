We have learned that two of the three items that contain his power, the Waterbinder ring and the Evergreen necklace, can be found in the Valley of Saints. The <font color="LEVEL">Pilgrims of Splendor</font> possess the Waterbinder, and the <font color="LEVEL">Judges of Splendor</font> possess the Evergreen. Please immediately for the Valley of Saints and bring back the ring and necklace. You're the only one who can do this. Then, I will entrust you with this task.
