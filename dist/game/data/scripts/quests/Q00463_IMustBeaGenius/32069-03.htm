Quite good. Now, listen carefully and take notes if you must.<br>
First, Golems send negative or positive numbers, but the numbers differ from each other.<br1>
Second, one Golem will send a random number betweenn 1~100, but the Golem that does this changes day by day.<br1>
Lastly, Golems exhaust their energy sending one final transmission before collapsing. We can get that log data if we watch carefully.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Today's number is %num%</font>. Collect all the log numbers until you have a value that is equal to <font color="LEVEL">%num%, and bring it to me.</font> If you are as good as you say you are, you should be alright.
