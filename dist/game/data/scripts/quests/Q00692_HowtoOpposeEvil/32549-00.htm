I don't know how a stranger like you happened to come here, but this is a very different place than Aden. Here the only law is power.<br>
Gracia was originally a barren land, and the sudden appearance of monsters has made survival even tougher. The weak do not last long, and many envy the dead -- at least they are at peace.<br>
If you've come here only to sightsee, you had better leave as fast as you can!<br>
(Only characters who are level 75 or above may undertake this quest.)
