<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Norman:<br>
Our guild, The Iron Gate, is involved with various reconstruction efforts to restore Gludio Territory from the devastation of war.<br>
We've gotten the Lord's permission to begin reconstruction in this area...<br>
But monsters have begun appearing in the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds where we get many of our important construction materials...<br>
Other factors have led to a shortage of resources in the manor. The Lord is seeking adventurer's help.<br>
When you have enough power, we could use your help!<br>
(Only characters level 21 or above may undertake this quest.)
