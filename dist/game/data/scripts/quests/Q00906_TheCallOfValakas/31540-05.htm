<html><body>Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
Would you believe that the Lavasaurus never used to exist? The Lavasaurus Alpha was the very first Lavasaurus ever created by Valakas here in the Forge of the Gods.<br>
Valakas created it to protect his lair. Created using a piece of Valakas's own energy.<br>
Now, that is a bit of information worth having. If you could bring me a piece of the Lavasaurus Alpha I bet I could make you an item that would aid you in your attack against Valakas.<br>
