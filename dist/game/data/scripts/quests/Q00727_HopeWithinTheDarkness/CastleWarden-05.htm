Of course you can participate. But before you do, there are several things you should know. There are 4 researchers currently inspecting the Rim Pailaka that can be entered from Rune Castle.<br>
Because of the mystical dream-nature of Rim Pailaka, we don't know what will happen to them if they "die" in there. Our goal therefore, is to bring them all home safely. <font color="LEVEL">People say attacks in that strange place develop over 3 stages. Defend them from each!</font><br>
One more thing. It would be unwise to enter Rim Pailaka alone. Find another clan member willing to accompany you. Then I'll send you in.<br>
There's no time to waste. Please hurry!<br>
