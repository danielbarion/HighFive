I'm very disappointed.<br>
If I had known your skills were this embarrasingly poor, I would not have assigned you this mission. You're lucky to still be alive! Still, a promise is a promise, so I will give you this <font color="LEVEL">Worthless Battle Supply</font>.<br>
I'll grant this reward to the leader who represents all of you.
