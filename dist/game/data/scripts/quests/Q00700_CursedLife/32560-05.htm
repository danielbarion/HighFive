Really? Thank you.<br>
If you hunt <font color="LEVEL">Rok</font> and open its stomach, you will find undigested remains. The same is true of the <font color="LEVEL">Mutant Birds and Dra Hawks</font>, although you'll find fewer remains in them.<br>
Bring me <font color="LEVEL">Swallowed Skulls</font> as evidence, as well as <font color="LEVEL">Swallowed Sternums</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Swallowed Bones</font>. We will reward you for your efforts -- especially for the skulls you bring back.<br>
One more thing: Rok fears the Dark Black Dragon's followers. That's why it emerges only when the Seed of Infinity is <font color="LEVEL">stabilized</font>. That means <font color="LEVEL">Rok can only be hunted when the Seed is occupied</font>. Remember that!<br>
Good luck and good hunting.
