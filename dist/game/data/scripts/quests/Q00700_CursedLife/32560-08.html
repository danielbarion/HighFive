Have you finished your hunting? Then show me the remains I asked you to bring back.<br>
Let's see...<br>
Oh...you brought back a lot! From this, I can tell that you caught <font color="LEVEL">Rok</font> and split its stomach open. Either that or you must have hunted a great many <font color="LEVEL">Mutant Birds</font>and <font color="LEVEL">Dra Hawks</font>!<br>
Here is the reward I promised. Let me ask you, though -- are you interested in hunting more of the creatures?<br>
