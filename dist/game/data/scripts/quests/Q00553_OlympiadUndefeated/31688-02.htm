<html><body>Grand Olympiad Manager:<br>
Enter the Olympiad and take on the challenge of <font color="LEVEL">10 consecutive wins</font>! As you know, consecutive wins means not losing along the way. Whether you have <font color="LEVEL">2 consecutive wins</font> or <font color="LEVEL">5 consecutive wins</font>, you will receive a reward. But it will be nothing compared to the reward for 10 consecutive wins. Also, <font color="LEVEL">5 and 10 consecutive wins</font> will get you the <font color="LEVEL">Medal of Honor</font>. If you're ready, you can come to me. But please remember that once you receive the reward, you cannot take on this mission again today.<br>
