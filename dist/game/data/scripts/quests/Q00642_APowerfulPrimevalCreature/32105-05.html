Good! I know that both the Wizards and Dwarven artisans will welcome your help. This place is far too dangerous for ordinary researchers!<br>
On to business, then. We need eggs and tissue samples from <font color="LEVEL">Pterosaurs, Tyrannosauruses and Velociraptors</font>.<br>
Just so you know, <font color="LEVEL">1 Dinosaur Egg</font> and 150 Dinosaur Tissues can be processed as a set.<br>
You can find dinosaur eggs by searching near a dinosaur's lair. But once you touch one, <font color="LEVEL">any dinosaurs nearby will rush back to protect the egg</font>!<br>
We will reward you for whatever you bring back. If you'd like to see a list of reward options, just say <font color="LEVEL">"I want to look at other items."</font> Good luck!
