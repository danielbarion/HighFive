Aye? Then I've a wee favor to ask of ye!<br>
Bring back the Nebulite Orb stolen by the Ol Mahum and ye'll have my support in your bid to become lord of Oren. Of course, the Wizards of the Ivory Tower won't object, either.<br>
It seems we lost 300 Nebulite Orbs. You find them, and we'll be penning our names together afore ye can say "Ach that's a mighty fine beard there mister Croop!"
