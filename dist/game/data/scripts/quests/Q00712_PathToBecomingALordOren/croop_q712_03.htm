It's as if you already knew what happened to me. All right.<br>
I wonder if you can help us.<br>
We sent a Nebulite Orb to the Ivory Tower a while ago. Nebulite Orbs are important, and we were supposed receive word of their arrival. Alas, we have yet to hear anything! It's taking TOO long to confirm their arrival! Could you confirm for us? You don't have to personally go, but can you send, a follower to Warehouse Freightman Marty in the 1st basement of the Ivory Towerand confirm?
