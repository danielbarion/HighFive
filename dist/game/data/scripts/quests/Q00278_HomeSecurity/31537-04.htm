Mighty kind of you. Tell you what... I'll pay you for killing those Sel Mahum <font color="LEVEL">Farm Ravagers or Farm Bandits</font> on my farm.<br>
I wish I could take your word for it, but I'm gonna need to see some proof before I pay you. Collect <font color="LEVEL">300</font> <font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum Manes</font> and bring them back as proof.<br>
A word of warning though... some Sel Mahum can't grow Manes, so it might take you some time before you find one that does.<br>
Best of luck, stranger.
