<html><body>Captain Lucas:<br>
I heard from <font color="LEVEL">Magister Mirien</font> in the Temple of Einhasad that the Sages of Magic, a group of magisters to which Magister Mirien belongs, are researching the Kaneus -- the monsters of the Kamaloka that recently came into existence; he has asked me for a favor.<br>
Kamaloka exists between this world and the infernal regions; it it regular monsters suddenly mutate into Kaneus.<br>
But we do not know the specific cause of this mutation.<br>
To learn more, they've asked me to provide them with <font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of the Kaneus</font>. Will you help me?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">(Only characters able to enter Kamaloka, Hall of the Abyss level 33 and 36, may undertake this quest.)</font><br>
