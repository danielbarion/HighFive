There was a great master named Marf. She made the ground, the sea, the sky, the mountains, and the forest using the energy of light and darkness granted to her by Einhasad and Gran Kain. She then created a race to help her work, the Dwarves. Marf taught them about crafting skills, the art of sculpting and architecture, and mathematics and measurements. The Dwarves then made more beautiful art than any other race, and made beautiful and practical buildings, causing other races to soon envy them. The Dwarves, not wanting to start a conflict, shared their arts and craft with other races, and received gifts in return for their generosity. <br>
