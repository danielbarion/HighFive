All you have to do is simply draw their attention and I will take care of the rest. Although now that I think it through, it would be even better if you could, uh, get rid of them.<br>
Do so and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Red Stones</font> that they carry. No questions! I told you I would reward you well for your trouble. In fact, if you bring <font color="LEVEL">744 Red Stones</font>, I'll give you something very special. Understand? Good -- we're agreed!<br>
Remember, all you have to do is to get rid of whoever you find on <font color="LEVEL">the first and second floors </font>of the tower. 
Good luck!
