<html><body>Trader Kunai:<br>
Other tribes may see this as an opportunity to puff out their chests and offer the Flame Lord something costly, extravagant...and utterly useless. But the Duda-Mara tribe is not vain; we simply wish for him to recover speedily from this illness that afflicts him. Accordingly, our elders offer the Flame Lord this rarest of medicines, <font color="LEVEL">Spider Dust</font>, able to cleanse both body and mind of all impurities!<br>
We risked our lives to hunt the Great Spiders that live high in the mountains, slew them, dried their legs in the heat of the sun, then ground them into a fine powder whose very fragrance can purify what is unclean. Take this to Centurion Nakusin so that he may speedily deliver it to Flame Lord Kakai!
