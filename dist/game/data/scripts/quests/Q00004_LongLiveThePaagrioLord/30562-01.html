<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Grookin:<br>
On behalf of the Neruga tribe, I, Grookin, offer this precious gift to the Flame Lord: the <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Axe</font>. Stained with the blood of many animals, it pulses with the lives that it took! Among our tribe it is said that illness will flee a body at the mere touch of the Bloody Axe!
