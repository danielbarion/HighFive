Thank you very much! I can tell already that you will prove very helpful to my experiment. Let me tell you about the materials I need.<br>
The primary ingredient is called <font color="LEVEL">"Energy Ore"</font>.<br>
You can acquire it by hunting the monsters in the <font color="LEVEL">Eastern Mining Zone</font>, which lies north of the Dwarven Village.<br>
The monsters you will encounter there include the <font color="LEVEL">"Red Eye Barbed Bat, Northern Trimden, Kerope Werewolf, Kerope Werewolf Chief, Northern Goblin, Northern Goblin Leader, Spine Golem and Enchanted Spine Golem."</font> These are the monsters you must hunt. Understand?<br>
Now, gather as much Energy Ore as possible. Ah! I am so busy! Busy! I must take care to revise the formula in the time we have left. Good luck!
