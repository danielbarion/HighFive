Undrias sent you? Very well; take this scripture to him. It was discovered in an abandoned mine in the Misty Mountains during a battle with those vile Orcs. Surprising, isn't it, to see something written by ancient Humans who also served Gran Kain?<br>
Undrias plans to recite a portion of this scripture during this year's Ceremony of Darkness, so give it to him as soon as possible.
