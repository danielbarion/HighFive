<html><body>Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>
Soon we will hold the <font color="LEVEL">Ceremony of Darkness</font>, our most sacred ritual, in honor of Gran Kain and Shilen. The Human Mystics of the Ivory Tower who witnessed it last year were awed at its magnificence, so we must make it even grander this year. But there is still much to prepare! Come see me again, and perhaps then we will be able to use your help.<br>
(Only Dark Elves who are at least level 2 may undertake this quest.)
