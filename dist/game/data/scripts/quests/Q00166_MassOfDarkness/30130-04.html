Where are the items you were to bring me? Fool! I will tell you again -- for the last time. Bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Ceremonial Dagger</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Trader Iria</font> at the Weapons Shop, the <font color="LEVEL">Ritual Wine</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Dorankus</font> at the Warehouse, and <font color="LEVEL">Garmiel's Scripture</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Master Trudy</font> at the House of Elders.<br>
Be quick about it or there will be a heavy price to pay, I assure you...
