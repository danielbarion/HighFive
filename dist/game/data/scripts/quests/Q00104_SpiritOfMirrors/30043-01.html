<html><body>Guard Johnstone:<br>
A few days ago, while patrolling the <font color="LEVEL">western parts of the School of Wizardry</font>, I encountered a werewolf <font color="LEVEL">near a bridge</font>. I drew my bow and chased after him, but all of a sudden, his body started to waver, and he turned into a great toad! Do you think there are some werewolves that know how to perform strange magic?
