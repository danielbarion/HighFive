<html><body>Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:<br>
I am sure you've heard, but... we, the ghosts of this station, are all unhappy souls who have gone mad because we are unable to hold a hammer or do any work. We were members of the Grey Pillar Guild, and as such, we wanted to reach the stars.<br>
If you don't mind, I ask you to give the ghosts a merciful end. They are dead already so you can't really kill them, but if you make them fall, they will finally be at peace.<br>
