That's what I want to hear! Fine, let's see you prove it.<br>
Innadril and Giran have just resolved a long-standing dispute about seaborne commerce rights, and full-scale trading between our two lands has finally begun. Unfortunately, it is already endangered by the lack of adequate protection. Even my family's losses have been significant!<br>
To restore security, you must eliminate the monsters who roam freely around here. The alligators near Alligator Island are a particular thorn in my side. I'll also need help recovering my lost freight... I think 10 of your followers will do. If you do these things for me, I'll support your lord.<br>
