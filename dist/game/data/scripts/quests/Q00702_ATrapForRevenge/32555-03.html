<html><body>Soldier Dius:<br>
First of all, Dius did not willingly succumb to the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Destruction</font>. As a result, he becomes stronger whenever the Seed becomes weaker. <font color="LEVEL">Unless the Seed of Destruction becomes stable, therefore, you can't defeat him.</font><br>
Even then, you can't you can't destroy <font color="LEVEL">Dius</font> by normal methods. He has an acute sense of smell and is very intelligent, so he rarely appears when there are a lot of people present. Instead he strikes isolated individuals when they least expect it.<br>
But he can be defeated! You just have to lay a trap for him! When Admiral Keucereus ordered me to destroy Dius, I spent months perfecting a trap.<br>
First, we need flesh from one of its subordinates: the <font color="LEVEL">Drak, Drake Wing or mutant Drake Wing</font>. Collect <font color="LEVEL">100 Drake's Flesh</font>. I need that much to prepare a single trap. Later I'll explain it more fully.
