I hoped that you would accept this challenge! You won't find a better opportunity to enhance your reputation and make a tidy pile of money.<br>
Let's cut to the chase. Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">Deadman of Destruction, Dius</font> that appears in the sky above the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Destruction</font>. It is a type of mutant Drake that has proven resistant to the power of the Seed. In fact, when the Seed is <font color="LEVEL">stabilized</font>, it and its Drake followers have been attacking our supply and transport ships. It has become a real problem for us.<br>
What do you say? Will you accept the mission?<br>
