What can a poor injured soldier like me offer?<br>
Well... Come to think of it, there is a box I hid long ago. I found it while exploring the Seed of Destruction. Funny, I haven't thought about it until now.<br>
But I don't know what's inside it. I think it's something heavy and precious, though. If you hand over the horn, I will give you whatever is in the box. Maybe it's something worth more than what Plenos can offer, eh? Or maybe it's something worthless. Care to gamble? What's life without a little risk, eh?<br>
