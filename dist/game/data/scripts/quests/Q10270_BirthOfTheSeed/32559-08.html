Actually, there is a Temple of Shilen beneath Keucereus Alliance Base. It is so secret that nobody knows about it. There is a priest of Shilen in hiding there. His name is Lelrikia. I think we need to ask him about this.<br>
The entrace is guarded by <font color="LEVEL">Soldier Ginby</font>. He seems to be in the pay of the priest these days, so his loyalty is suspect. But go to him and ask him to let you in.
