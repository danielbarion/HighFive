Ah, is that why you dare to disturb me! Very well, I will tell you.<br>
The Seed is a power that once existed in Shilen's realm, the so-called world of death. To you it would seem like another dimension. As you approach its center, you can draw upon an amazing amount of magic power.<br>
This is what men call the Seed. I do not know who named it so, but it is not inappropriate. Just as seeds planted in fertile soil grow, so this Seed planted in Gracia grew strong.<br>
