<html><body>Jinia:<br>
The name Jinia is derived from a flower that used to bloom in this region. It was not rare, but beautiful nonetheless. When Freya began her reign as the Ice Queen, the Jinia flower stopped blooming because of the eternal winter. Always waiting for a spring that never comes. We named the guild Jinia after that flower because when it blooms, it will mean our mission is complete.<br>
