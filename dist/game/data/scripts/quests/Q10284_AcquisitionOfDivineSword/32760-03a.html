<html><body>Jinia:<br>
We were not always the Jinia Guild. We were once called the Knights of Kanna and it was our job to protect the royal family. When Felicia was expelled by her conspiring enemies within the court, we loyally followed her. When she became Freya, our mission quickly changed. We swore that we would see the threat Freya posed to the world ended and the once gentle princess Felicia returned. Thus, we changed our name to Jinia.<br>
