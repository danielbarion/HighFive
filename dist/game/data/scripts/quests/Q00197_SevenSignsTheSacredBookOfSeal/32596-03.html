<html><body>Library of Sages Director Sophia:<br>
I'm so sorry: document number 1667 was lost in the great fire. However, there is a copy... a handwritten, incomplete copy. It is a mysterious record in its own right--we have no record of its title, year of publication, author, or subject.<br>
I wonder if anyone has actually read it? Well, I'm going to need to see some identification before I can turn this over. Do you have a library card?<br>
