<html><body>Vulcan, Blacksmith of the Flame:<br>
Hey, are you gathering Flames? Alas, you have not gotten 1000 of them yet. You do realize that you can get them from the <font color="LEVEL">Monsters located within the Forge of the Gods</font>. If you so happen to bring me <font color="LEVEL">1000 Flames</font>, I'll give you something special in return.<br>
It might also be useful for me to mention that my younger brother, <font color="LEVEL">Rooney</font>, also collects these Flames in the Forge of the Gods. Aye, that lad... he be a wanderer no doubt! He's mentioned that <font color="LEVEL">he will part with one of his belongings to anyone who delivers 1200 Flames to him</font>. He is not someone easy to locate however!<br>
