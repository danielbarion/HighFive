You must kill five talk bugbear raiders and bring back their heads. Their names are Athu, Triska, Motura and Lanka, and they are led by one called Kalath. These <font color="LEVEL">talk bugbear warriors</font> have been attacking and pillaging merchant carriages. I'm sure you would deal with these outlaws even if it weren't a requirement of the test, wouldn't you?<br>
