<html><body>Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:<br>
My examination of the bead has led me to two conclusions.<br>
One is that the Dirty Bead had traces of Haari's blood on it, which leads me to believe he is dead. The second thing I concluded was that this bead is part of a necklace ... an artifact from my village, actually ... that Haari had stolen before disappearing.<br>
While I would have preferred to bring in Haari himself, if I were able to retrieve the pieces of this necklace, I might be able to restore a piece of my village's history.<br>
Would you help me find all the pieces?<br>
