I like the way that you work. Dedicated. Get back to the fields and get rid of the Mucrokian threat. Remember to collect hides from the <font color="LEVEL">Mucrokian Fanatic, Mucrokian Ascetic, Mucrokian Savior, Mucrokian Preacher, and Contaminated Mucrokian</font>...<br>
Oh, and if you get an <font color="LEVEL">Awakened Mucrokian Hide</font>, that reduces the amount of hides required to claim a reward.<br>
See ya in a bit.
