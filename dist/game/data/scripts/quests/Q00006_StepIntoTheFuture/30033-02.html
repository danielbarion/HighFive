Hmmm... I see. It is certainly expensive to travel to the mainland, especially to a place as far away as Giran.<br>
But I think it would be an invaluable experience for you. When I was about your age, I had the opportunity to spend some time abroad, and it did me a world of good. I have an idea! <font color="LEVEL">Sir Colin Windawood</font> is looking for young people with ambition and potential -- I think you would be ideal.<br>
Take this <font color="LEVEL">letter</font> to Sir Colin and tell him you are there at my recommendation. I'm sure he will cover your travel expenses.<br>
Sir Colin loves to explore the ancient ruins of our island, so don't expect to find him in his office. I've heard that he's been spending a great deal of time at the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory</font>, so check there first. Good luck!
