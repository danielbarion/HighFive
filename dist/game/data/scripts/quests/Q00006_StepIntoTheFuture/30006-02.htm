I'm very fortunate to have a job that allows me to travel across the continent.<br>
How many others can say they've seen the grandeur of Aden Castle or visited Giran's bustling markets or watched the sun set over the waters of Heine?<br>
Despite my love of travel, though, I was happy to return home here to Talking Island...at least for now. I must admit that I do miss the night life in Giran!<br>
