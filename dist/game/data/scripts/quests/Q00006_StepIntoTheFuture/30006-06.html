How wonderful for you! Both Baulro and Sir Colin are such helpful people that I'm not surprised.<br>
Here is a special Scroll of Escape capable of opening a Dimensional Door to Giran. <font color="LEVEL">Pay close attention: it can only be used once! Use it like any other Scroll of Escape. Here as well is the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of the Traveler</font> that Sir Colin asked be prepared for you. When you are ready to return to Talking Island, show it to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Galladucci at the luxury store in Giran</font> and he will help you. I should warn you that he's a little peculiar, but he knows his business inside and out.<br>
May your journey be filled with adventure and excitement!
