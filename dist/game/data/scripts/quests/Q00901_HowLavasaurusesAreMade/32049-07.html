What interesting research!<br>
I tried various things with the fragments, and was able to make a totem containing the power of the dragons.<br>
The effect differs, depending on how the fragments are combined. There is also a problem with range of output, so it can only be used where the power of the dragons can be felt. But still, the effect is... well... startling.<br>
There are four types of totems.<br>
