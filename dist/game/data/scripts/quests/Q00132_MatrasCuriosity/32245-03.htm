Actually, I need a blueprint of the structure of the tower of the Steel Citadel. I have learned who possesses the information I need, but I can't get it on my own. Perhaps...someone like you could go into the tower, find that blueprint and bring it to me. Apparently the <font color="LEVEL">Demon Prince</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Ranku</font> in the Steel Citadel have access to the blueprint I need. Please bring the <font color="LEVEL">blueprint</font> to me, and I'll reward you very well.<br>
Oh, one last thing: take these raw ore. They might look rough, but they function just like other ore. I think they will help you in this task.
