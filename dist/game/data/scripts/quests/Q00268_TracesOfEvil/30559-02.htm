As you know, creatures infected by the curse of the <font color="LEVEL">Fiend Kasha</font> are everywhere, even just beyond the walls of our Orc Village.<br>
We cannot simply wait and watch any longer -- we must discover the source of the curse. I wish to use the vision of the Duda-Mara tribe to divine it, but the task may be too difficult for me alone.<br>
If you add your power to mine, however, we might succeed. Will you help me?<br>
