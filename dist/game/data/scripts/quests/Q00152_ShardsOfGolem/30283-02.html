<html><body>Blacksmith Altran:<br>
This time, I'm thinking of making the hammer head with stone instead of steel or a hardener like damascus. Why a stone axe, you ask, as if we were craven barbarians? The stone I'm talking about comes from the fragmented bodies of golems.<br>
There are <font color="LEVEL">stone golems</font> in the woods to the northern area of this island where there are very few people. They are magical creatures that were created by the elves who lived on this land a long time ago. I don't know much about magic, but those golem fragments are very strong yet also lightweight. Please bring me five <font color="LEVEL">stone golem fragments.</font>
