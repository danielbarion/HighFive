<html><body>Elias:<br>
I am Elias, a teacher at Einhovant's School of Magic. Some time ago, my students and I went on a field trip to the northern part of the island to collect herbs needed for class, and many of the students fainted after catching a <font color="LEVEL">strange fever.</font> It has been a week since they fell ill, and we still have not found a cure. I'm worried out of my mind when I think that my students might die from this.<br>
Thankfully, Priest Yohanes thinks he might have a remedy. Won't you find me some <font color="LEVEL">medicine ingredients</font> for my young students who are dying? I truly need your help. That ingredient is the <font color="LEVEL">Giant Spider's Poison Sac,</font> but I believe that someone like you can easily obtain it.<br>
