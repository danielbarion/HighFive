I have been contacted by the lord's representative. I believe we should obtain the Mandragora Roots that Spellbook Seller Luke has requested.<br>
Send one of your followers to search for the roots while you focus on obtaining information concerning the whereabouts of the resistance. Speak with Mercenary Captain Sophya, my lord -- she is fighting them and is very knowledgeable.
