<html><body>Expedition Leader Sobling:<br>
It is now possible to explore the upper level of the Giant's Cave thanks to the help of many adventurers. Because of that, now we can finally undertake a more rigorous expedition.<br>
It will be more dangerous than past forays into the Giant's Cave, but I hope you will help us nevertheless.<br>
