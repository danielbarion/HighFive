Thank you. Hunt down <font color="LEVEL">Klennot, Hamlet, Palit, Imagro</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Cursed Lord, Cursed Guardian, Cursed Seer, Hirokai</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Upper Giant's Cave</font> and retrieve Legacy of Ancient, <font color="LEVEL">Knowledge of the Giants Anthology</font>. For your information, you have to bring chapters from 1 to 5.<br>
And one more thing! It would be better to go there with your fellows. Please keep this in mind. The expedition can be continued only if you safely bring evidences. Okay. Thank you.
