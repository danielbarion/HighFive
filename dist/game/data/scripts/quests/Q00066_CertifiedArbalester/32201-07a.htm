Very well, I will tell you.<br>
As you know, Kamael society is organized along military lines.<br>
Certain necessary tasks must be conducted in secret for the good of our society.<br>
We are the group entrusted to carry out those sensitive missions.<br>
All our members are able to use Arbalester skills.<br>
If you can find our secret group and pass the entrance test, you too can aspire to be an Arbalester...<br>
