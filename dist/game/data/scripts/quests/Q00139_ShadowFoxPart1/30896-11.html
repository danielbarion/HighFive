Do you know Iason Heine, the president of Heine Merchant Association?<br>
He has been responsible for paying a large portion of the taxes owed to the lord, and for financially supporting the repair of Innadril Castle.<br>
But some people say that he is simply waiting for an opportunity to seize greater power.<br>
Our mission is to discover evidence that proves that Iason is in collusion with the Tasaba Lizardmen.<br>
If this is true, it will seriously damage his career and reputation.<br>
