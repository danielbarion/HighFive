Since our island was opened to the outside world, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of goods and people landing at our port.<br>
In fact, the road connecting it to our village has now become one of the island's major thoroughfares.<br>
Unfortunately, all the traffic has also attracted monsters from the Hills of Gold; the creatures are coming down to attack caravans and feast on unwary travelers.<br>
We do not have the manpower to dispatch an armed force to clear the Hills of Gold, but I have been authorized to hire adventurers to help deal with the situation.<br>
Interested?<br>
