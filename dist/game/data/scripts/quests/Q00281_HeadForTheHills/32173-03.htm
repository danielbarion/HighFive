I like your spirit! Very well, go to the Hills of Gold and slay <font color="LEVEL">Green Goblins, Hill Werewolves, Muertos Archers, Mountain Werewolf Chieftains, Muertos Guards and Mountain Fungus</font>. Bring back their <font color="LEVEL">claws</font> as proof.<br>
We will pay Adena equal to the number of claws you bring, or you can trade a set of <font color="LEVEL">50</font> claws for an item.<br>
Good hunting!
