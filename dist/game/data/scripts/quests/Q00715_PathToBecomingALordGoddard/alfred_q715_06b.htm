The Ketra Orcs are in turmoil. Unless we act, we could be negatively affected. The solution, of course, is to also create turmoil among the Varka Silenos. I suggest that you send trustworthy followers to the Ketra Orcs to help stabilize them while we prepare to weaken the power of the Varka Silenos. Have your agents approach the Ketra messenger, Wahkan. Then leave the rest to them.<br>
Remember that their credibility will be damaged if they also helped the Varka Silenos.<br>
(Water Spirit Ashutar can only be defeated through Part 2 Quest.)
