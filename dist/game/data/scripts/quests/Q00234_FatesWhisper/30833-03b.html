You learn quickly. What we want from the Tower of Insolence is none other than the <font color="LEVEL">Blood of the Angel</font>. I won't go into details, since if you helped Hanellin you already know what it is and what it can do. I will simply ask that you enter the Tower of Insolence and dye these <font color="LEVEL">30 pieces of white cloth</font> red with the Blood of the Angel.
