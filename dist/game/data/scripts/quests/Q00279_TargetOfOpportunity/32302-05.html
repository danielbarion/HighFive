Alright, here's what you need to do. Defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Cosmic Scout, Cosmic Watcher, Cosmic Priest, and Cosmic Lord</font>. You will pick up a <font color="LEVEL">fragment of their essence</font> after defeating them. Assemble these parts and you will have a Seal Breaker, a stone that will allow you to travel directly to Ranku and Demon Prince by fooling the Tower's Seal into thinking you a devil.<br>
Bring the parts to me and I can convert them. Do you wish to enter now?<br>
