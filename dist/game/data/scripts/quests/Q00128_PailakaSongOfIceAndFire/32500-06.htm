<html><body>Inspector Sinai:<br>
There are 4 chaotic Sprites. If you defeat them in a certain order, their powers will revert to their former stable state.<br>
Inside, you will also meet our inspectors. They are superior enchanters, and they will certainly help you if you need it.<br>
You should know that the power of this sword is not yet complete; you will need a Sprite's help to strengthen it to its full potential. The book contains instructions about how to do that.<br>
Finally, the fish in the temple may provide useful items. I recommend you catch them if you can!
