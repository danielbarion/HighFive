If what you say is true, then you really did come here from another dimension!<br>
There has been much speculation about other dimensions at our Ivory Tower, but it seems your Ivory Tower is even more advanced... <br>
If the cause of our troubles lies in the fissure of power in this dimension, you should be able to return to your dimension by stabilizing that fissure. What I mean is that if you can restore the balance of the Sprites' power here, you will be able to return to your world.<br>
In any case, as an otherworlder you will surely be less affected by their power than we are. I place this task on your shoulders, my friend.<br>
