<html><body>Sister of Silence Eris:<br>
Yes. I am Eris, Abbot of this Monastery. I am a diciple of Solina, also called Saintess of Elmore-Aden. You look surprised, and I imagine you should be. By now you've noticed, I'm not really alive. This is the result of my training, years of practicing asceticism, a lifetime spent following Solina.<br>
