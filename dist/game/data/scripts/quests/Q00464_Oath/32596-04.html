This book was a gift from <font color="LEVEL">Seresin</font> who is now a Cardinal. He gave it to me but I lost it during a fit of spring cleaning. How strange that you have it now... are these pages bunny eared?!<br>
...Listen. You probably didn't know this, but I don't believe in coincidence. You found this book for a reason. Maybe that reason was to return it to <font color="LEVEL">Cardinal Seresin in Oren Town</font>?
