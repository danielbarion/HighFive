Huh? I've seen this book...?! ...Where did you find this? I thought I lost it... Thank you so much.<br>
I remember spending countless hours with my nose in this book, studying religion and daydreaming when I was young. Now.. I'm too busy for such things. Anyway, this book is sentimental. I appreciate you bringing it to me.
