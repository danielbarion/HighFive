You've guessed it, I want that Jewel of Innocence! Beasts crave them, but only the person who raised the cub can retrieve the Jewel of Innocence.<br>
Also, and I don't know why, but you only get one chance to acquire that jewel. I've only seen it once, truly unforgettable to say the least...<br>
Get this jewel for me and the reward will be great. What do you say?<br>
