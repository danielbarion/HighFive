Oh, wonderful! You've arrived!<br>
Frankly, even though I often say that I want to move away, it's hard to leave the big city. However, one must have a lot of Adena to live in this territory right now!<br>
I was saving up a little every day, but when I returned home one day, I found that my sister had disappeared! She left a note saying that she was going out into the world to find fame and fortune for both of us.<br>
As her older brother, I could never provide her with all the things she has wanted. Recently, I've heard that her name is on a list of graduates from Talking Island.<br>
I must see her, and give her a sword as a gift. It's the least I can do. I hate to ask you this so suddenly, but...<br>
Can you help me?<br>
