<html><body>Gludio Prison Warden:<br>
I am the warden of this castle prison. This monster dungeon was discovered only recently.<br>
I suspect that other castles also have such dungeons. My duty is to keep this basement prison area safe.<br>
Having monsters appear and disappear at will here would hardly let the castle inhabitants sleep soundly at night, eh?<br>
Unfortunately, we don't have the numbers to handle this task alone.<br>
We need help from the clan members.<br>
We'll compensate you for your assistance, naturally.<br>
