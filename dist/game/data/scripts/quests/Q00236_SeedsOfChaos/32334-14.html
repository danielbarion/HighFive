Compared to the Kamael of that time, you are not weak.<br>
But compared to other constructs of the Giants and servants of the gods, your race was childish.<br>
You needed time to mature, to grow in strength. Two strains of Kamael were created. One was powerful beings, the Spiculan Kamael, who could be the spear aimed at the skies.<br>
The other strain consisted of Kamael like you. These Metusela Kamael were created weak, but time was on your side...<br>
Metusela Kamael were also created with the help of the <font color="LEVEL">wisest four</font> of that time. Thanks to that, you have better adaptation skills than we do.<br>
