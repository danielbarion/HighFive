Hello, and welcome to the middle of nowhere. Who am I? I like to think of myself as a business man of sorts. What I offer to you is a game of chance. I am giving you the opportunity to win <font color="LEVEL">Soul Stone Fragments</font>. You agree to give me a predetermined number of fragments. And in return, you have the chance of winning a random number of fragments. Sound good? Well then, how much can I put you down for?<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest Seyo give1">Give Seyo 1 fragment.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest Seyo give5">Give Seyo 5 fragments.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest Seyo give20">Give Seyo 20 fragments.</a><br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest">Quest</a>
