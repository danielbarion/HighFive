<html><body>Priest of Blessing:<br>
The Einhasad Temple is currently accepting donations for the needy and helpless. Those who donate will receive a small token of appreciation, allowing them to remain blessed by Nevit. Remember, true love is shown in giving, not receiving!<br>
Your soul is as beautiful as your appearance. We have also prepared Nevit's Voice in a form called Nevit's Hourglass, which will last a fair while. I'd give them all to you but we have to share them amongst all who donate to the temple. Let me know how much Adena you wish to donate. And may the blessing of the gods be with you always.<br>
Remember, choose carefully because you won't be able to donate again for 20 hours.<br><br>
