When a seed germinates inside a monster it becomes a crop. The best crops 
are harvested from monsters of a level similar to the sower.<br>
Bring your harvested crops to me and you will be rewarded. The lord usually compensates farmers with items, some much more valuable than the crops.<br>
Of course, you should be willing to gamble a little, right?<br><br>
