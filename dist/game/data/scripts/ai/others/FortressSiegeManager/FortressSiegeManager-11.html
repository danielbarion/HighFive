I'll tell you why. You may be surprised to learn that I am a member of the Tactics Corps. You see this fortress? Places just like it used to protect the people of this land from Monsters and foreign armies. And now? Greedy, grasping fools have occupied the fortress, using its might to extort money from the area residents... So I'm guarding this area, searching for someone worthy to defeat that band of bandits and occupy the fortress on behalf of the citizens here.<br>
You seem a likely candidate... What do you say? You could hire our mercenaries, and with our help I'm sure you'd be able to capture the fortress. Do you want to try?<br><br>
