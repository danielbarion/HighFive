<html><body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br>
If your subclass skill is above a certain level, you can transfer that power to your main class.<br>
Because this is a very dangerous mission, however, you must be certified in order to carry it out.<br>
If you were certified by your subclass master and have brought the certificate, I will transfer some of your subclass power to your main class.<br>
Be warned: this will inflict a serious shock to your soul. You must strengthen it in preparation for this rite.<br>
In order to learn certified subclass skills, you must first speak to Hardin and obtain the first sealbook. Hardin's Academy is in Dragon Valley.<br>
