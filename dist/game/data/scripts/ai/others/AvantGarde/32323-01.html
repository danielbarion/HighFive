<html><body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br>
I am Avant-Garde, the Transformation Wizard. I have long wandered through the land and only recently settled here.<br>
In fact, my young friend, I am not a wizard of the Ivory Tower. You look surprised! Heh. Think of me as a wanderer who acquired a special power quite by chance... My magic, however, requires some very specialized items.<br>
If you have acquired these unique items from the dark wizard in Hardin's Academy, then perhaps I can help you.<br>
