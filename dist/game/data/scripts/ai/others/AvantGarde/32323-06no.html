<html><body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br>
An excellent decision, I think. In fact, it is very difficult to even get the herb. Since there's no one except that vicious Dark Wizard who lives in Dragon Valley who knows the technique, I didn't feel like it either...<br>
But isn't it a pity to throw away all of the skills for which you have already been certified?
