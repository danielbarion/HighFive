<html><body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br>
It is a tremendous endeavor to obtain subclass certification and learn the appropriate skills. Beyond the purely physical effort, the burden on your soul is beyond your imagination... It is almost a suicidal venture.<br>
However, the process can be undone.  There is a special kind of herb that can be used to remove your previously chosen skills. The price of the herb, though, is approximately <font color="LEVEL">10 million Adena</font>... I have the herb here, so I can cancel the certification anytime once you have paid.<br>
If the certification is canceled, <font color="LEVEL">the current certification status  and skills will vanish immediately -- poof!</font> Now then, do you really wish to cancel certification?<br>
