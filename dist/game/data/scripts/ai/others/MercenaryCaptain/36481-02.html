<html><body>Mercenary Captain:<br>
As the war dragged on, those in power sought for a way to wage the conflict without risking their own positions. Politics, eh? No rich lord wants to weaken the strength of his loyal troops if he doesn't have to.<br>
So hiring mercenaries like us to fight their battles for them became an easy option.<br>
And, I gotta admit, it's a good way for a soldier to make money. Win on the battlefield and you'll earn fame and fortune at the same time.<br>
But remember one thing... You must always fight as well as you can, no matter who has hired you.
