For all my travels and experiences, there is still one thing I cannot understand. Why does even the mention of Dark Magic send Humans into such an uproar?<br>
They have no trouble killing each other with sword and spear, so scruples about plotting and scheming...<br>
There must be more to this, perhaps some sort of conspiracy to learn its secrets and keep them from the other races. I wouldn't be surprised if the Ivory Tower even has a secret facility for studying the Dark Arts...<br>
