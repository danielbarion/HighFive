Ah, a <font color="LEVEL">rabbit</font>, eh?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">To raise your level to hyena, pay me 10 glittering medals and I'll play a game with you! </font>Meow!<br>
The game is a test of both your luck and skill, the two essential qualities of a collector. Meow! Your abilities are evaluated by the number of glittering medals you collect, and your luck is tested by how often you win the game.<br>
If you lose, pay 10 more glittering medals and try again! You'll eventually win. Meow!! Would you like to give it a try?<br>
