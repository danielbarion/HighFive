Wow! <font color="LEVEL">Are you really a fox level collector?</font> Meow! I wouldn't have known at first glance, but now that I get a closer look at you, I can see it in your eyes! I'm sure your'e already familiar with the game, so I'll keep the explanation brief...<br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you wish to become a wolf level collector, pay me 40 glittering medals and I'll play a game with you! Meow!</font> You can play as many times as you want, as long as you have enough glittering medals.<br>
The game tests both your abilities and your luck, the two essential qualities of a collector! Meow!<br>
