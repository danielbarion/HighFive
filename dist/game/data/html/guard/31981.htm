If a village is peaceful, security must be tight, right? While we're on the subject, let me tell you that a neutral village like this one actually means more work for us guards. If we are vigilant, the inhabitants complain that we are being repressive. If we ease off, they complain that we are lazy. It's very difficult to maintain a happy medium, let me tell you!<br>
