Kamaloka is an invader from another world. We do not know precisely when it happened, but we discovered a sealed space, similar to a Dimensional Rift. We call it Kamaloka.<br><br>
To enter it, you must meet certain requirements. You cannot enter a basic Kamaloka alone. To fight alone, find the pathfinder to guide you to Rim Kamaloka.<br><br>
Only a few can enter. Usually <font color="LEVEL">under 6 in the Hall of the Abyss and 9 in the Labyrinth of the Abyss</font>. Those are the limits.<br>
You should also be well-rested before entering. According to the priests, it requires a similar amount of energy as entering the Sealed Dimension. Unless your soul is well rested, you will not be allowed in.<br><br>
Each Kamaloka possesses a certain level; only characters near that level may enter.<br><br>
There are also several kinds of Kamaloka. Even if they appear to be the same Kamaloka, they are divided into several patterns. So far, two distinct patterns have been identified: Hall and Labyrinth. You may only enter the Hall type now, and soon you will be able to enter the Labyrinth. The Labyrinth is more complicated and has more enemies than the Hall...<br><br>
Finishing Kamaloka earns you the <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Kamaloka</font>. The energy is condensed and becomes the Essence, and the Essence of Kamaloka <font color="LEVEL">takes time</font>. So patience is required. Collect enough Essences of Kamaloka, then find Pathfinder agents in town.<br><br>
(Kamaloka - Hall of the Abyss can be used in real time once a day, Kamaloka - Labyrinth of the Abyss once a day, and Near Kamaloka once a day.)<br>
(Only characters whose levels are 5 levels lower or higher from Kamaloka's applicable levels can enter.)
