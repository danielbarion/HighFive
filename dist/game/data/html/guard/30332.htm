<html><body>Captain Bathis:<br>
Welcome, young traveler! I am Captain Bathis, the commander of the guard that provides security to both this village and the surrounding area. May I offer you a word of advice? What kind of outfit are you wearing? I understand the desire to be fashionable, particularly among the young...but armor is not for looks. Choose a set capable of protecting you in battle, regardless of what it looks like. Tsk tsk! Young people these days...<br>
