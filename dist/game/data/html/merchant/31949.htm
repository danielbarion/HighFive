Nice to meet you! I'm Rouge, the owner of this shop. Oh my, you're badly sunburned. Oh, no...sorry to stare. I just sympathize with adventurers who lack quality accessories and end up weatherbeaten and old before their time. Here, have a look! Wearing any of our shop's accessories will make you look young, rich and very fetching.<br>
