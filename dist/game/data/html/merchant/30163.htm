Welcome, traveler, welcome to the Ivory Tower!<br>
Most people see this place only as the residence of Wizards, but you might be surprised to learn how many non-mystics make their home here as well. Originally, I was a Paladin who was sworn to Einhasad' service. It's not like I broke my vow, but I must confess that I didn't think I'd ever end up here...<br>
Let me caution you, friend: strange things happen here. Don't go snooping around unless you can handle trouble...<br>
