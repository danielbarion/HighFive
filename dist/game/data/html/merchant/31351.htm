These days I think contantly of the old days, when this port was filled with Gracia's trading fleet. It was even busier than the ports in southern Giran and Heine.<br>
But once diplomatic relations with Gracia were broken off because the war, the trading fleets stopped coming as well. Now, only a few small ships are left, although sometimes ocean-going ships loaded with adventurers anchor here...<br>
Oh, I almost forget! There is a regular shipping route now from here to Gludin Port in Aden. Interested in boarding one of the liners?<br>
