Welcome! Are you here to board a ship? Ship traffic has increased a lot now that routes to Elmore are opened again. At first it was just cargo, but now we have enough interest to operate a passenger liner. It's nice to see all the activity again!<br>
Ah, a liner heading to the Town of Rune is about to leave. Would you like to buy a ticket?<br>
