Is this your first time in Hunters Village? Then let me give you a bit of information about this town...<br>
Originally, hunters chasing rare prey broke new ground in this village. By rare game, I mean creatures that were difficult and dangerous to hunt. So don't imagine people catching rabbits in the hills when you hear about the "hunters" here. They're rough enough to deal squarely even with the royal house!<br>
