<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Cliff:<br>
Welcome, welcome! Isn't that equipment heavy? Put it down and give your back a rest, friend!<br>
In fact, why not leave what you don't need here with us? You won't find a safer, more secure place to store your valuables than a Dwarven warehouse. Empires may rise and fall, but our service goes on uninterrupted...<br>
