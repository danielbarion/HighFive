<html><body>Freighter Daisy:<br>
??, ??, ?? -- my beloved siblings, all 3 of them, though they can be a handful! Ah well, I wouldn't trade them for their weight in gold. You know, it is very rare for the whole family to be posted to the same place, even within the same guild. We owe our good fortune to Uncle ???.<br>
Family is so very important, don't you think. We often go too long without showing them how much we care . . . if fortune has smiled on you lately, why not send a gift to your family? You can use our warehouse freight service -- we deliver promptly even over long distances!<br>
