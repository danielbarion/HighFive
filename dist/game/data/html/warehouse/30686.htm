<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Silva:<br>
Hello! What can I do for you? For almost 1,000 years, the Iron Gate Guild has provided safekeeping of valuables. Whatever you deposit will be kept entirely secure, and you can withdraw it from any of branches...<br>
Hmm...I think I said it right this time... Hey, Mr. Sorint, I said it correctly, didn't I?<br>
