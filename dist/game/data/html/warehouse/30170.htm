<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Radic:<br>
Greetings, adventurer. Welcome to the Ivory Tower. I recommend you that you leave any nonessential items with us and then go explore this place. It is essentially an entire city built by Wizards for Wizards. We are currently in the 1st basement, where you can find various Wizard Guilds.<br>
Believe it or not, back during the days of the Elmoreden Empire, this place wielded power throughout the continent.<br>
