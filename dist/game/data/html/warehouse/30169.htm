<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Marty:<br>
Do you have an item too heavy to carry around, but too valuable simply to abandon? Why not make use of our warehouse? We Dwarves have branches throughout the entire continent. When you deposit an item with us, you can retrieve it from anywhere!<br>
In fact, we even have a branch inside the Ivory Tower. And our facilities are so secure that not even the King himself could touch your valuables!<br><br>
