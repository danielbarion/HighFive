<html><body>Lich King Icarus:<br>
I've never seen you before, have I? Ah, yours is a face full of vitality and life. I like it very much. Perhaps I might sample your inner self as well...<br>
My, my, what a shocked expression you wear! Ha ha! I am Icarus, the sole survivor of the 13 Lich Kings who once shook the Elmoreden Empire to its very foundations... Ah, but perhaps the word "survivor" is somewhat inaccurate, eh?<br>
