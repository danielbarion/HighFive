May the blessing of starlight be upon you, friend. For 50 years I have labored here in Human lands, far from home and family. It is a hard duty, but one essential for the safety of our people.<br>
How I long to sit again under the shadow of the Mother Tree and drink from the cool streams of the forest!<br>
