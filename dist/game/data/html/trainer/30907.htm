Some time ago, a strange Elemental Summoner visited Anabel. It seems that she was a former paramour of the old Lord of Innadril. They had apparently been together for a century or more! You wouldn't know it to look at her, but she is as old as your grandmother's grandmother. Regardless, I still can't condone those kind of Human-Elf relationships. They're unnatural! Tell me, how would you feel knowing that your lover would stay forever young, even as you became old and gray?<br>
