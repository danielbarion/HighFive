Innadril is unique, even to an Elf like me. This excessive worship of Eva is...distasteful to me. True Elves focus their adoration on Einhasad, not some watery tart of a lesser goddess.<br>
Hmph! At least there is a Temple of Einhasad here, even if it's far smaller and less opulent than the one dedicated to Eva. I hope you will find time to visit it and sing praises to the glorious goddess of light! The High Priest of Einhasad can also manage any cleric- or clan-related business. Ah, wait a moment... Why are you here?<br>
