It would give me great joy to test your ability and confirm your talent.<br>
Actually, Schuttgart is not yet recognized as a place where warriors can hone their abilities, so Grand Masters like myself have had a difficult time developing our own skills.<br>
Were more warriors to visit us, we would be able to assist them even as they assist us. Isn't that the best of both worlds?<br>
