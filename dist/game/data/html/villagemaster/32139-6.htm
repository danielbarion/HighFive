Vice Hierarch Casca:<br>
To become a Trooper, you must gain the approval of someone with authority.<br>
I believe Master Gwain currently has that role. You may be able to find him in the Town of Gludio.<br>
Return here with a recommendation letter from him and the requisite skills, and you will become a Trooper.<br>
