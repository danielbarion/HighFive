Vice Hierarch Casca:<br>
Kamael have 3 skills, which are selected in the second class transfer.<br>
The first is a combat skill with a Short Sword, and allows you to wield the Sword in one hand while controlling your innate magic with the other. Those who master this skill are called <font color="LEVEL">Soul Breakers</font>.<br>
The second skill allows you to use ancient Sword techniques to focus your inner strength and cause tremendous damage to your enemy. Only male Kamael may learn this skill. Those who do are called <font color="LEVEL">Berserkers</font>.<br>
The final skill deals with hunting and spiritual attributes that allow the wielder to attack the enemy when and where they least expect it. <br>
That skill is reserved only for female Kamael, however, so I cannot say more about it...<br>
