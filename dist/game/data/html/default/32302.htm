Welcome! I have waited so long for you to come here. 
I must tell you that there is a strong magic barrier on the Tower of Infinitum. 
If someone who is not a devil enters the tower, 
this magic will be activated and break everything into pieces. 
The only way to avoid it is to disguise yourself as a devil.<br>
To do so, you must kill a devil and cover your body with its blood...<br>
