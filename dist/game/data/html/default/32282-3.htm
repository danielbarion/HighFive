So impatient! Good manners never hurt anyone, you know... Oh, well, so you wish to know about the requirements for entry? Very well.<br>
First of all, the magical characters above the entrance signify two people holding hands. I interpret this to mean that one person alone will not be granted entry. This glyph here...represents "mighty power." Perhaps the ones who enter must possess a certain level of strength.<br>
Hmm...you can ignore the rest of these symbols; I'm sure they have no bearing on this subject.<br>
...<br>
To be perfectly honest with you, I can't actually read the rest yet -- but they don't seem very important based on their position.<br>
(To enter, form a party of two characters who are over level 78.)<br>
