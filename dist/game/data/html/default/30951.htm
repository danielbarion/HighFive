Goodness! How did you get up here? You probably didn't run... Did you use a Dimensional Vortex?<br>
Anyhow, you have a steel heart for coming all the way up here; this place is controlled by the Guardians of Holy Tower, by the Platinum Tribe and by angels. To their eyes, researchers like us are intruders. They won't let you go easy, so be careful!<br>
