The elemental attributes of water, fire, wind and earth, and the holy and dark attributes that symbolizes light and darkness, are extensions of the gods who correspond to each attribute and are the source of magic power. Attribute magic flows through the matter of this world, causing action and reaction and creating new matter and energy. It is even possible to enhance combat equipment by this energy by bestowing specific attributes onto it. As that attribute's magical power grows stronger, your strength will increase as well.<br>
Here's a tip to remember: each attribute becomes even stronger when pitted against its opposite. Change the bestowed attribute to take advantage of each situation and you will reap the benefits!</body></html>
