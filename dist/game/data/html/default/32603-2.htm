Status of the Seed of Infinity constantly changes by success or failure of an attacking party's attack, caught monsters, and etc... Therefore, this becomes a one cycle, which can be divided into a total of 6 steps. So, sometimes we have to block their power by attacking because the power of this Seed becomes too strong, but sometimes it is more important to defend efficiently when the power of the Seed becomes weak. And if this region becomes stable you could acquire collections which couldn't be acquired at ordinary times.<br>
Because information like this is considered very important, so it always delivers to Keucereus Alliance Base. Thus, Admiral Keucereus and General Dilios get to know it. You can find about an occupational cycle of this place through them.<br>
Be sure to remember. All of your movements effect the cycle of this region. Therefore, don't die recklessly even if you want to die.<br>
