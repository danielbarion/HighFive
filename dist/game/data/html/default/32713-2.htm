<html><body>Pathfinder Agent:<br>
Daytime Zaken is another aspect of Zaken.<br>
Unlike his nighttime counterpart, he hides himself because he knows he is weak...<br>
But there is a way to find him. Light a <font color="LEVEL">candle on a barrel</font> and it will show you the way.<br>
But be careful! The candlelight may also alert his subordinates to your location.<br>
Compared to Nighttime Zaken, Daytime Zaken is not that strong -- you should be able to attack him with a combined force of <font color="LEVEL">1 to 3 parties</font>.<br>
