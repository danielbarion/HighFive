Welcome, adventurer!<br>
We have observed that certain monsters have recently become stronger by magically influsing themselves with more powerful attribute capabilities. I trust that you have also been attempting to magically strengthen your own attributes in order to fight them. As it happens, while exploring the continent I acquired a special skill to handle magical attribute power. The power can't be completely controlled, but even my partial skill wil prove useful!<br>
Unfortunately, I cannot simply give you this secret potion; the ingredients are extremely difficult to obtain and I must have sufficient funds to support my disciples in their quest to find them!<br>
