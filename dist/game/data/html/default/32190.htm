<html><body>Vice Heirarch Mao:<br>
May the blessings of Nornil be with you!<br>
If you travel south from here, you can see <font color="LEVEL">Nornil's Garden</font>, home of Nornil, Mother to this Isle of Souls. My name is Mao, and I am in charge of this place. If you can overcome the ordeals of this place and meet Mother Nornil, you may be reborn as a true Kamael warrior. There will be pain, but after the pain comes joy.<br><br>
