<font color="LEVEL">The Seed of Infinity</font> is an infernal region ruled by Shilen's disciple, the undead fiend <font color="LEVEL">Ekimus</font>. We know little about him, unfortunately.<br>
But I can you something about this region itself. Here <font color="LEVEL">space itself is organically linked together like some vast living organism</font>. Just as your whole body is affected if you injure one part, so the Seed of Infinity's overall power decreases as we slay monsters in this region.<br>
But if you are killed within, then your soul will feed and strengthen the power of the entire Seed.<br>
That is why it is so important that <font color="LEVEL">only parties of skilled adventurers be admitted to the Seed of Infinity</font>.<br>
