From here you can take an airship to Gracia. We don't expect any trouble, but the magister and I are here to ensure order.<br>
However, I still feel uneasy. How can I sing songs knowing that many of our passengers are traveling to the land of their death? And if we can't contain the evil in that land, Aden itself will be in grave danger.<br>
What have the wizards gotten us into, eh?<br>
