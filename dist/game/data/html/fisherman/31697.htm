Do you know about these hot springs? The effects of the nearby Forge of Gods has created a whole network of them around here. Even more surprising, <font color="LEVEL">there are special species of fish living in these hot springs. How can any fisherman worth the name ignore an opportunity like that!</font><br>
Enjoy the fishing here and let me know if you need anything!<br>
