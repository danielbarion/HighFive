You may already know this, but our store is different from other stores in the region. We combine high-grade weapons to create Dualswords.<br>
We are able to combine almost every type of sword. If we can't...well, then <font color="LEVEL">you should go to the capital or seek out the Blacksmith of Mammon.</font> You never know... There might be a capable blacksmith hiding where you least expect him.<br>
However, crafting Dualswords isn't only about skill and technology. The Merchant Guild controls how many Dualswords can be made in order to prevent a glut.<br>
The number each territory is allowed to manufacture isn't large, so it's difficult to acquire a Dualsword Craft Stamp.<br>
If you do happen to acquire a stamp, bring it to me with the swords you want combined. I promise I will make you a magnificent weapon!<br>
The two swords to be combined into a Dualsword must be either Superior weapons, Common weapons or Masterwork weapons.<br>
Superior weapons can be combined with other Superior weapons, Common weapons can be combined with other Common weapons, and Masterwork weapons can be combined with other Masterwork weapons. Even a Masterwork type must be above B-Grade.<br>
Oh, another thing. If you invest some kind of a skill in a weapon, you can't combine it with another.<br>
Remember as well that an Enchanted weapon loses its effect once it is combined with another.<br>
Now, select a weapon.<center><br>
