Augmenting means give energy to weapons or accessories. Augmenting is simple, but it isn't always accurate. A few days ago, a mysterious ore called Life Stone, which has a very similar characteristic to Soul Crystals, was found in Black Anvil. If you bring this Life Stone and some other necessities, I will augment accessories and weapons for you. Life Stone used in augmenting is greatly influenced by its owner, so once augmented only the owner can use it. Also, any accessory or weapon higher than one's capability does not display the effect of augmenting. And one last thing. Accessory augmenting requires excellent materials. How about it? Want to augment stuff?<br>
